                            <p> When I look at the article, there are only UI interac4tion designs not many words? I 
                                learned from this article that the posssiblities of UI design are endless. There are ways you can 
                                combine videos and object animations. I was fastinated how you can advance light and dark color designs.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article are all of the different design transitions. The different design 
                                transitions show that there are so many ways to incorporate color design contrast and smooth sliding. 
                                Each design is unique and matches the function needed for the site. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite design is the easy to grow design. It is simple but complex at the same time from transitioning 
                                from various vegetables. They do this through a swiping motion whiching to each page. When clicking at the task 
                                bar, you can see it reveals various infomation such as the graphs. What I liked the most is that the design looks 
                                simple but it can hold much infomation with beautiful clor contrast. </p>
