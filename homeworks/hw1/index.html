        <li>1.What I learned is that eye catching design is based on proper hierarchy drawing attention to important details. I learned the importance of intent towards what design might keep the consumer on the app.</li>
        <li>2.My favorite part of the article is when the article talked about breaking down the app. It is fastinating that the app captures our attention from placeholder text, detail holds, and different flows.</li>
        <li>3.What I found cool was " By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
        <li>4. I rate the article 10 out of 10!</li>
        </ul>
